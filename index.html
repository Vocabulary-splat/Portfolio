              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Hi this Lawrence's website! I'm currently working as Lead Narritive designer 
              at Alethia Studios. However, I'm always open to new revenue streams.

              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I lead the Narrative team for this
              demo though a rocky production, as every feature except characters saying dialouge got cut.
               I was able to achieve this through careful 
               delegation and many hours of personal work. I did it though 
               using google docs, microsoft suite, and gantt charts. 
               This project was my first real project, actually having a page on steam
               but more importantly, I worked with a wondeful team, and we all
               had to make many consecions to have a product.

       &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;I wrote the script for the Chef Niya trailer. 
       The process was interesting to me at least, as it was a two column script, and seconds 
       needed to be balanced to hit a few second time window. 
       I used Celtex, and my own, sheer human determination. 
       While I did not have as much of a hand as I would have 
       liked in the final product, as I was not able to animate in Unreal at 
       the time. I feel it very encouraging to have a product that started 
       with my script up on steam. </p>

              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; "Boxing" is a short demo for a narritive game. So far, my favorite I've completed.
              It was my first Unreal project, getting to know the ropes, ways I could break it, etc. 
              While it was a steep learning curve, my passion and unflinching
              work ethic carried me along. I did this project alone, simply to improve my own skills as a dev.

              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; This website was a small passion project.
              I made this with HTML and CSS. Thing is, however, HTML is not hard.
              Most programming is a spesfic subset of math under unntiuitive 
              constrants known as computer architecture, then Operating system, 
              then engine, and then you own work elsewhere. HTML, on the other hand 
              is basiclly highlighting. And while I was re-making my portforlio, 
              debating              
              tranferring it to any standard or boring Wix or such service, 
              I wondered how'd that reflect on me as a dev
              unwilling to go the extra mile. So instead I'm going the extra
              mile, and instead of cheaping out, I'm actually using the 
              highlighters. <br>
              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;That being said, some don't go the extra mile due to time and budget constraints
              and those were considered. I do not like gradients or clutter,
              yet, I wanted something with a professional level effort.</p>

              <p>
               <br>
              &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;My name is Lawrence, I am a Gemini twin, and my passion is narrative design.
              When I was young, I took a test with almost every mental
              thing that could be tested for, and I got the highest lexile score
              the procte had seen. And in time, I learned that does little for
              quality of writing. See, what I enjoyed in writing was making an expereince
              and using big words, and understanding Diaspera, Coastetic, and Choom
			  is not what made my work best. What made it best, was interaction, like with Unreal engine
			  Godot, 3D modeling and animation. Games in a sense. What I want to do
			  and why I'm with Alethia, is that I want to make expereinces.
			  Sure one of a kind expereinces, but simple, comforting expereinces as well.
